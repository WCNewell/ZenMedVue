## The Problem

2018 is an exciting time to live in Denver, Colorado. The economy is great, the happiness index is great, the surrounding landscape is gorgeous, the overall mood in the metro area and quality of life is really great. But, this also means droves of (mostly young) people are flocking to the Denver area driving rent and mortgage prices to historical heights.

Clark Newell is 45 and a brand-new developer in Denver. While his new career will be lucrative someday, he hasn’t always been so successful, so before he can move into a higher-end community he must pay off some serious bills. Clark is single and lives alone. He pays quite a lot of money for his tiny “refurbished” 1970s apartment. While he may have a cute little kitchen by Ikea, he still has low popcorn ceilings and paper-thin walls. Clark is surrounded on all sides by people half his age who have a lot of energy and typically act and live like, well, people half his age. In order to get out of this situation Clark will have to work very hard for the next few years, and when he is home, he will need to get as much peace and quiet as possible. Clark believes in “live and let live,” and understands the desire to have fun so, unless things gets really out of hand, he would rather find non-confrontational ways to reduce his personal stress and maybe mask some of the everyday noises that can interrupt his work-at-home, meditation and sleep.

Clark likes to occasionally have fun himself, so he can be part of the problem too. Since Clark lives alone, he frequently lets the TV, stereo or radio run in the background and keep him company whenever he’s doing anything else but sleeping. Clark is also pretty tidy so inevitably he will be all over the place vacuuming, dusting, etc. for at least a few hours every weekend. Clark also has a cat who loves to chase feathered cat-toys all around. All of this causes quite of bit of noise with thin walls and hard Pergo flooring. This is always really annoying to Julie, a young nurses aid, who has a stressful job and horrible hours. She works weekend graveyard shifts, so this means she is always trying to sleep on Saturday/Sunday mornings and afternoons when Clark is upstairs doing his annoying weekend thing.

## The User Story

Clark and Julie both live in a dynamic, highly populated area. They are by far not the only ones getting on each other’s nerves. The are late night games in the propfessional rugby stadium across street which also includes a police and fire station, so sirens, sports arena noise and traffic all contribute to the problem.

## The User Experience

Clark, Julie and all of their neighbors all need to balance their varying schedules and stressful, busy lives with daily inspirational affirmations, meditation tips, holistic stress-reduction techniques, and get some rest with a white noise generator used to mask each other out when needed.

White noice generators already exist, but this particular version is geared towards the eclectic professional who has become very interested in trying new and unique things. ZenMed’s user is an urban dweller who loves Star Wars, hot yoga, isolation tanks, baseball games, $10 cocktails, middle-eastern food, mountain meadows and tropical beaches. While offering the usual white noise sources one would expect, this generator also offers sci-fi drones, and ethnically inspired environments. The ecclectic user will also insist on interacting with an interesting an aesthetically pleasing interface. 

## Features

* Inspirational Quote of the Day (api generated)

* Short meditation and Anti-Stress Tips and Techniques (researched and hardcoded or possibly api generated)

* White noise generator - Traditional (Crickets, Waterfalls, Rainforests, Ocean, Fan)

* White noise generator - UNIQUE (Sci-fi, Ethnic, Random)

## Tech Used

* React Native for smartphone app development
* World’s Best Quotes API for daily affirmations
* SoundBible and ZapSplat for white noise
* Ableton Live for editing loops
* Heroku for loop storing database
* Database connection using Express, Knex, and Postgres

##   The Challenge

The challenge will be I have never made anything in React Native. The goal will be at minimum to have the above 4 features, and a very attractive user interface. Stretch goals would be to self-edit and / or self-compose some white noise loops with Ableton Live.
