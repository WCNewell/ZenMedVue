# ZenMed

> A Vue.js project

ZenMed is a meditation app built in Vue.js. This first iteration includes an audio player with visualizer, daily inspirational quote from Quotes.rest API and a board of white noise generating buttons.

This project began as a React Native app but did not get sufficient audio functionality working in time for the capstone presentation. I have since been advised that React Native may not be the best framework for this type of app and that diving into React Native without first learning more about React is a big leap. Futhermore, I'm interested in moving along with the Progressive Web App trend and will therefore likely refactor this as  PWA and become more familiar with React in the process.

Once the app has been refactored, it could then include an API for more meditative music, more content regarding meditation advice, looping for the sound board buttons, sound board compression and equalization, and some original music or sound effects created by myself!
